                    <p>Information technology is a growing field that offers relatively secure positions for those with solid technical skills and at least a bachelor's degree in an IT-related field. From support to engineering, there are several specializations that deal with the various facets of information technology.</p>

                    <p>The field of information technology (IT) covers the design, administration and support of computer and telecommunications systems. Some of the positions in this field include database and network administrators, computer support specialists, computer scientists, software programmers and system analysts. The majority of career tracks in IT entail design and operational tasks related to computer hardware components, networks and software applications.

Professionals in the IT field work with businesses and organizations to set up and support viable computer networks that will keep systems efficient and reliable. IT encompasses all hardware and software used in the storing, creation and accessing of information. Examples of technologies that professionals work with are firewalls, databases, media storage devices, networks and the Internet.</p>

                    <p>Aspiring IT professionals typically need a bachelor's degree in a technology field, such as computer science, information systems management, programming or networking. Even without a degree, experience in an entry-level help desk position could help IT professionals advance with professional certification or vocational training. The fundamentals of a degree program generally include computer hardware, programming, networking, and technical theory. Depending on the major, students could also learn IT management, website development, computer circuitry, systems analysis and database management. Some programs also include internship opportunities. To work as a computer research scientist, a Ph.D. degree is often necessary.

Information technology degree programs are widely offered at many community colleges, vocational schools and universities. Certification preparation programs are also offered at many of these schools, though testing for credentials typically takes place at an approved testing facility. Look into these articles from Study.com to learn more.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Certification</h2>

                    <p>Almost all hardware and software manufacturers offer certification options that allow IT professionals to demonstrate their proficiency with particular technologies. There are also many industry-standard IT certifications that cover fundamental and advanced understanding of general hardware, software and communications technologies. Certification isn't required to work in the field, but is often preferred by employers.</p>
